Here you can find my projects, contributions, and more about my work. My journey began at Texas State University, where I studied advertising, learning to understand consumer behavior and create impactful campaigns. Now, I'm on the verge of completing the Atlas Software Engineering Full Stack program at Atlas School in Tulsa, diving deep into coding and digital solutions.

I thrive on bridging the gap between planning and execution, using my background in advertising and IT to bring a unique perspective to project management. Whether it's coordinating teams, managing IT projects, or ensuring seamless integration of technology solutions, I excel in creating structured processes that drive success.

Let's connect and discuss how we can collaborate to achieve excellence in project management and IT. I'm looking forward to connecting with fellow professionals and enthusiasts in these fields.
